                    and become mired. The two larger frogs weigh over 150

                        usually is. They will lock their door and retaliate if is battered, 
                        but try to reason with the party to let them leave,
                        taking their petty loot only and leaving the rest safely hidden.
                        All remaining brigands will flee if their leader is downed.

                        The leader has 5 g.p and a gold chain worth 20 g.p. They have a chest
                        buried under the rubble where the wall collapsed. It holds
                        200 c.p., 2 bolts of fine cloth, a crystal
                        flagon and four goblets, an inlaid wooden box
                        with ivory handles and decorations, and 4 +1
                        magic arrows. Each item is worth 3gp. Three turns of digging are required to uncover
                        the chest of loot. The chamber is floored in block flagstones,
                        has ebon-colored wall hangings, burnt and tattered now
                        and the jumbled wreckage noted. The brigands pitch
                        bedrolls in odd comers, and the remains of fires can be noted
                        in the northern fireplace. They are totally unaware of the

                        value left). If the party seeks to investigate the room, scores of
                        bats will angrily flutter around, and in the confusion it is 75%
                        likely that whatever is held for a light source will be dropped
                        and be extinguished. If anyone is striking at these bats when
                        the lights go out, it is 50% likely that he or she will strike a party
                        member-the one nearest. If a hit is scored, normal damage
                        from the weapon accrues to the unfortunate victim.</td>
