                    A few torn sacks, broken barrels, and shattered weapons

                        as it was considerably below floor level, the area was dug
                        lower and the entrance to the pool enlarged. Evidently, some

                        ago, this monster took the pool as its own, and it now disputes
                        with any creatures entering, hoping to make a meal in the
                        bargain. (It is held at bay by the men-at-arms from area 16.,
                        below, by pole arms and prodding; all others take their
                        chances.) The monster has been fairly successful, and there
                        are bones and litter around and in the pool, although the
                        central section is very deep. If badly wounded, the crayfish
                        retreats into the deep water of the pool and does not return
                        for at least a day. There are 19 g.p., 30 s.p., and 17 c.p. and a
                        sword near the back (southwest) pool edge. In the water on

                        and a bone tube. The pin is under a skull (human) and the
                        tube under some bones. Unless searchers use their hands,
                        there is a 50% chance that either or both treasures will slip off
                        the ledge and be lost below. The tube is water-tight and
                        contains a scroll of magic-user spells (push, stinking

                        Lareth the Beautiful is the dark hope of chaotic evil: young,
                        handsome. well endowed in abilities and aptitudes, thoroughly
                        wicked, depraved, and capricious. Whomever harms
                        Lareth had better not brag of it in the presence of one who will
                        inform the Demoness Lolth! He has been sent into this area to
                        rebuild a force of men and humanoid fighters to gather loot
                        and restore the Temple of Elemental Evil to its former glory.
                        Of course. Lareth is but one of many so charged, but he is
                        looked upon with special favor and expectation. He and his
                        minions have been careful to raid far from this area, never
                        nearer than three or four leagues, traveling on foot or being
                        carried in wagons of the traders from Hommlet. None of the
                        victims are ever left alive to tell the tale, and mysterious
                        disappearances are all that can be remarked upon, for no
                        trace of men, mounts, goods, wagons or draft animals is ever
                        found.
                        Evil to the core, Lareth is cunning, and if the situation appears
                        in doubt, he will use bribery and honeyed words to sway the
                        balance to his favor. He is not at all adverse to gaining new
                        recruits of any sort, and will gladly accept adventurers into
                        the ranks, but he will test and try them continually. Those who
                        arouse suspicion will be quietly murdered in their sleep; those
                        with too much promise will be likewise dealt with, for Lareth
                        wants no potential usurpers or threats to his domination.
                        His room is lavishly furnished with thick rugs, wall hangings,
                        soft chairs and couch, cushions. wines and liquors, dishes of
                        sweetmeats. A brazier continually burns to warm the place
                        and send a fragrant incense into the air. While he carries but
