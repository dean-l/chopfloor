                        fiercely, even to the death, but if a convincing offer is made they
                        will be inclined to stop and listen; and if they are offered
                        3 or more gold pieces each, they will desert. If double the above is
                        initially offered and paid, they will lead the party to the north
                        passage going to where "Master'' is, and even tell the party
                        that there are human guards. The gnolls will then proceed
                        east to the exit and never come back. Remember that
                        conversation with these creatures must be in gnoll, bugbear
                        or ogre speech.</td>

                    <td class="value">When the
                        dungeons were dug a natural pool of water was found, and
                        as it was considerably below floor level, the area was dug
                        lower and the entrance to the pool enlarged. Evidently, some
                        connection to an underground stream exists, for some time
                        ago, this monster took the pool as its own, and it now disputes
                        with any creatures entering, hoping to make a meal in the
                        bargain. The monster has been fairly successful, and there
                        are bones and litter around and in the pool, although the
                        central section is very deep. If badly wounded, the crayfish
                        retreats into the deep water of the pool and does not return
                        for at least a day. There are 19 g.p., 30 s.p., and 17 c.p. and a
                        silvered shortsword near the back (southwest) pool edge and a bone tube

                        balance to his favor. He is not at all adverse to gaining new
                        recruits of any sort, and will gladly accept adventurers into
                        the ranks, but he will test and try them continually. Those who
                        arouse suspicion will be quietly murdered in their sleep; those
                        with too much promise will be likewise dealt with, for Lareth
                        wants no potential usurpers or threats to his domination.
